# Case Study: LOYALTY ZK Link

### Loyalty Program Campaign

## Challenge

[Zk.Link](https://twitter.com/zkLinkorg) wanted to find a way to incentivize their community to experience their brand-new product design as well as celebrate the release of [zk.Link](https://zk.link/) Testnet 2.0.

## Solution

zkLink launched a $5,000,000 giveaway program rewarding every participant with a zkLink Loyalty NFT on Project Galaxy. The NFT was the certificate to farm in an exclusive liquidity pool with much higher yields.
