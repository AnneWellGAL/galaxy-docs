# Galaxy Pathfinder

## What it means to be a Pathfinder

Pathfinders are similar to Galaxy brains but a bit more simplified, there are a lot more pathfinders than Galaxy brains. The reasoning for this is the conditions are not the same, Galaxy brains are vetted by galaxy team and have more conditions for keeping the role.

Pathfinders are users that help their fellow members along the path of the galaxy ecosystem. Pathfinders are also those that perform outreach in the galaxy community finding new paths for us all to work with and discover. We need pathfinders with passion and energy to help us build a more complete and friendly galaxy ecosystem.

Same as our Galaxy brains its possible to lose the role due to activity or poor behavior or by having gone completely inactive. Users can lose the role but will be contacted once before or after losing the role, or In extreme circumstances (complete inactivity) (bad behavior) they can lose the role immediately without warning at the discretion of the team. We do not demand or require anyone to spend a specific amount or incorporate task based structure to keep or receive the role, its more about spirit ethic and recognition from those around you and not just how long you have spent in the server.

Not everyone can participate in these programs and we will do our best to recognize those that deserve it, we also will listen to the voice of other members to accurately give the role to the right person but please remember these programs are not about how long you spend in the server, someone can join later than you and still and receive the role.

**As stated above users can participate at their own will in the galaxy community, community team will check on pathfinders to make sure everyone is being the best they can be.**
