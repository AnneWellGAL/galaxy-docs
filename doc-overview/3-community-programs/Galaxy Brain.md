# Galaxy Brain

Galaxy Brains are top tier community leaders, they go above and beyond to help their fellow community members. This can be with basic crypto discussion, campaign issues, translations and general Project Galaxy information.

Galaxy brain role is not something you can apply for or ask for, they are chosen by the team for the amazing effort and volunteer work they put in. If brains are no longer acting as community leaders or have gone completely inactive they can lose the role after being spoken to at least once. In extreme circumstances they can lose the role immediately without warning at the discretion of the team.
