# Galaxy ID

To putÂ this in the most simplest way as possible, Galaxy ID is aiming to become your Web3 LinkedIn. Project Galaxy is a miracle space where digital credentials float around, and we are now taking them to another level.

For all the users on Galaxy,

- Galaxy ID can be your universal username that will represent your multichain/multiwallet identities in Web3.
- You can display the credentials collected in the Web3 world and showcase the history of your achievements.
- As a metaverse DID, developers can integrate Galaxy ID toolkit and offer customized features to users based on their digital credentials, or simply enrich user profiles in the product. This will open up a lot of possibilities and redefine the future of Web3.

The alpha version of Galaxy ID is live. Visit [https://galaxy.id](https://galaxy.id) to get started.
