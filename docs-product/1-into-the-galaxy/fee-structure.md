# Fee Structure

For each interaction with Galaxy Protocol, there will be a platform fee collected by Project Galaxy Treasury. **However, this fee is currently waived under our beta testing period.**

If a user is participating a NFT campaign on Galaxy, the user needs to pay transaction fee to the blockchain network in order to claim & mint the NFT. Gas needed for the transaction is estimated to be ~170,000 on Ethereum Mainnet, which is ~$5 when Gas Price = 15 and ETH Price = $2,000. Galaxy Protocol also support gasless minting feature for the campaign issuers to pay transaction fee on behalf of the user.
